&lt;p&gt;Long time no see! I just landed back in CA from a long overdue mini-retirement through London, Scotland, Sardinia, Slovak Republic, Austria, Amsterdam, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long time no see! I just landed back in CA from a long overdue mini-retirement through London, Scotland, Sardinia, Slovak Republic, Austria, Amsterdam, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some unpleasant surprises awaited me when I checked in on the evil e-mail inbox. Why? I let them happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are just a few of the goodies that awaited me this time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-One of our fulfillment companies has been shut-down due to the president’s death, causing a 20%+ loss in monthly orders and requiring an emergency shift of all web design and order processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Missed radio and magazine appearances and upset would-be interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-More than a dozen lost joint-venture partnership opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I go out of my way to irritate people — not at all — but I recognize one critical fact: oftentimes, in order to do the big things, you have to let the small bad things happen. This is a skill we want to cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I get in exchange for temporarily putting on blinders and taking a few glancing blows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I followed the Rugby World Cup in Europe and was able to watch the New Zealand All Blacks live, a dream I’ve had for the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I was able to shoot every gun I’ve ever dreamed of firing since brainwashing myself with Commando. Bless the Slovak Republic and their paramilitaries (video at the end of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I was able to film a television series pilot in Japan, a lifelong dream and the most fun I’ve had in months, if not years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-I met with my Japanese publisher, Seishisha (Tel: 03-5574-8511) and had media interviews in Tokyo, where the 4HWW is now #1 in several of the largest chains..&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category></entry><entry><title>A trading algo is as good as the person that wrote it</title><link href="https://6rivers.github.io/a-trading-algo-is-as-good-as-the-person-that-wrote-it.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-10-13T01:20:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-10-13T01:20:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Ranganath S</name></author><id>tag:6rivers.github.io,2021-10-13:/a-trading-algo-is-as-good-as-the-person-that-wrote-it.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Short version for index and feeds&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following is a review of my favorite mechanical keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
